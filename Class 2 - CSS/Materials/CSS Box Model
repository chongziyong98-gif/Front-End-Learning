CSS is a box
Content > Padding > Border > Margin
Imagine a parcel: 
 - Margin is outside the box, 
 - Border is space in between box and bubble wrap
 - Padding is bubble wrap
 - Content is item

Flex Container:
 - A container with many boxes inside
 - Container = Father: we can adjust the general attribute and arrangement of the boxes (alignment, justify, in row/column)
 - Boxes = In real practise, the boxes size might change from time to time; for example, weigh of particular box want make greater than others. 2:2:1 of the container
