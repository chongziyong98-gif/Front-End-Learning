Normal Flow:
1. When two elements meet within a block (container). It will not able to present at our confortable ways
    - Example: span sentences + image
2. When we want to show many spaces or paragraph, it will not appear as what we want
    - Example: I   am   atomic > I am atomic
3. Box & Box will have margin in between. We might no wanted to see it

Refer Day 12 for sample.

Solution:
1. Create Float (Day 13)
    - The float is a layer on top of the element, so that it will show the message that we want to see.
    - float make overlap of blocks element, and gaps the situation happened in (normal flow: 3)
    - float can make the boxes to continue as horizontal. (Commonly use on horizontal directory of website)

    Problem arise from Floating (Day 13 - cont)
     - Possible overlapping on floated item and no-floated items.

     Solution:
     - Add height on block (but most of the time, height setup is repeative & not good to see)
     - Use clear: both for non-float element. (If under same block)
     - Use overflow: hidden + clear: both for block (If element in different block)

2. Create Position (Day 14)
    - Relative Position (This method doesn't fix the normal flow)
    - Absolute Position (For each position set, each layer will be created, so they will overlap each others)
    - Fixed Position (This position will always remain fixed, no matter how page are moved. For example in real life, the trademark)

    Problem arise from position (Day 14 - cont)
    - All positioning will inherit from container (father)
