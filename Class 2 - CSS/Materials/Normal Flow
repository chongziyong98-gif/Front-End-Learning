Normal Flow:
1. When two elements meet within a block (container). It will not able to present at our confortable ways
    - Example: span sentences + image
2. When we want to show many spaces or paragraph, it will not appear as what we want
    - Example: I   am   atomic > I am atomic
3. Box & Box will have margin in between. We might no wanted to see it

Refer Day 12 for sample.

Solution:
1. Create Float (Day 13)
    - The float is a layer on top of the element, so that it will show the message that we want to see.
    - float make overlap of blocks element, and gaps the situation happened in (normal flow: 3)
    - float can make the boxes to continue as horizontal. (Commonly use on horizontal directory of website)
